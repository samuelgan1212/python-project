# python-project
  Hi! Guys. This are some projects i did during the summer camp in community college. To run this, I would suggest you download the 
Python in https://www.python.org/downloads/ . The first and Second project is a shopping checking out system. And the third one is
a employee checking-in system. And the forth one is a mini coding calculator. And the fifth one is a mini toss game to test you lucky
or not. Enjoy!!!
